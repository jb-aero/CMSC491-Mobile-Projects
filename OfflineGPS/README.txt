How Method 2 works:
Badly. What I was intending was:
1) Use magnetic sensors to determine original orientation.
2) Use gyroscopes to determine change in orientation.
3) Use accelerometers to determine acceleration in directions based on orientation.
4) Use acceleration to determine distance travelled.

What I tried to settle for:
1) Hold phone upright and facing north
2) Use acceleration data to determine distance traveled.
